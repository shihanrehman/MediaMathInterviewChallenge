Media Math Interview Challenge 3/5/2015

Generate a live feed of the NYC MTA transportation lines 

You are provided with the API: mta.info/status/serviceStatus.txt 

Scrape the Names and Statues of the transportation lines in the API (Subway, Bus etc..), and organize them by name and status

Since the API is in XML and not JSON, use the NOKOGIRI gem to scrape the API 

The documentation regarding the use of the NOKOGIRI gem can be found on the NOKOGIRI website
